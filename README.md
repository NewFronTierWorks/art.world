# art-world

NFTW-art.world allows museums, galleries and private collectors to tokenize art works using the CDWA-NFTW standard, IPFS data storage and Tezos blockchain technology for ownership proofs. This allows every piece of work to become interactive by allowing patrons to purchase into the life and longevity of the work.
